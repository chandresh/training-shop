https://github.com/chandresh/training-shop

1. rails new shop -d postgresql -T --skip-bundle

2. git init; git add .; git commit -m "initial"

5. Template

6. delete public/index.html

7. create a controller & action for homepage.

8. rename css to scss and covert all image references to something like:

background-image: url("templatemo_body.jpg");

9. Find the content area / main area and put: <%= yield %>

10. Put the code we like to see in our homepage, like we have a fake instance variable.
And then we make the code work!

11. Add model & change migration to add precision & scale:

rails g model Product name description:text price:decimal model_no

t.decimal :price, :precision => 8, :scale => 2

12. Added a truncate for description:
<%= truncate(product.description.to_s, length: 10) %>

13. We created a class method:

def self.home_page_products
    order.sample(9) # random 9 items
  end

24. Create a has_many association between category & products

25. On products form: have a drop-down of categories to choose.

26. On homepage, the category list should be functional

-----

27. Added HABTM:
    - added has_and_belongs_to_many to both product.rb & category.rb
    - created a join table:

    rails g migration join_table_categories_products # blank migration

    class JoinTableCategoriesProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :categories_products, id: false do |t|
          t.integer :category_id
          t.integer :product_id
        end
      end
    end

    - created some categories in console
    - You can now use something like in console or otherwise:
    Category.first.products.create
    Category.find(10).products.create
    Product.first.categories
    - in the products form, we used:
        form.association  :categories, as: :check_boxes



28. Has many through for manufacturer
		
	- created two models: manufacturer & product_manufacturer
	- we added associations:

class Manufacturer < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name
  has_many :product_manufacturers
  has_many :products, through: :product_manufacturers
end

class ProductManufacturer < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :manufacturer_id, :product_id

  belongs_to :manufacturer
  belongs_to :product

end

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :description, :model_no, :name, :price, :inventory, :image, :category_ids, :manufacturer_ids

  has_and_belongs_to_many :categories

  has_many :product_manufacturers
  has_many :manufacturers, through:  :product_manufacturers

end

    - You can now use something like in console or otherwise:
    	Manufacturer.first.products
    - in the products form, we used:
        form.association  :manufacturers, as: :check_boxes

	

29. Added a search form & routes.
30. Different ways to render a collection with partial (_product.html.erb):

<% @products.each do |product| %>
    <%= render partial: "product", locals: {product: product} %>
<% end %>

<% @products.each do |product| %>
    <%= render partial: "product", object: product %>
<% end %>

<%= render @products %>
